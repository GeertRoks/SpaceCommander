# Space commander

Geert Roks, 2017

### Concept
A multiplayer game for 3 players. The objective of the game is to destroy the incoming asteroids. The commander has all the information about the incoming asteroids, but can only send notes to the hull specialist or the weapons specialist. The hull specialist can turn the turret and the weapons shoots with the right kind of ammunition. They tune on the notes send by the commander so they know where to turn or what ammo to use.
Because the commander has no auditive cues can it be played by a deaf person and the other two roles only need auditive cues, so they can be played by blind players. This is a unique situation, because blind and deaf people aren't able to communicate. Blind people want to talk and deaf people want to sign.

### Todo
